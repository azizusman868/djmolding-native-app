Plastic injection molding is the process of filling a mold tool with liquid plastic resin under great pressure. The tool may comprise a single cavity or hundreds of cavities in order to make indefinite numbers of parts.
There are many advantages to plastic injection molding. These include the ability to make large volumes of parts quickly, high surface quality, many resins to choose from, color flexibility, and durable tooling that can last for years.
* Thousands of resins to choose from
* Economies of scale
* Stable and repeatable
* Excellent surface quality
* Overholding for more design options
* Multi-cavity and family tools

Injection molding of Liquid Silicone Rubber (LSR) is a process used to produce pliable, durable parts in high volumes. During the process, several components are necessary: an injector, a metering unit, a supply drum, a mixer, a nozzle, and a mold clamp, among others.

Rapid prototyping is the process of developing prototypes for products as fast as possible. Prototyping is an integral part of product development. It’s where design teams create an experimental product to apply their ideas.
It is the process of developing prototypes as fast as possible to emulate a final product design. It is a series of techniques used to model a scale prototype of a physical component or an assembly using CAD data.
CNC stands for computer numerical control, which is a technology to control the machining tools automatically by applying a microcomputer that is attached to the tool. CNCs machines would operate according to the coded programmed instructions, such as the movement of the machines, the feed rate of materials, the speed, and so on. There is no need for operators to control the machine manually, thus, CNC helps to improve the efficiency and precision to a large extent.

High automotive performance demands parts that handle it all. Plastics perform from the engine to the chassis; throughout the interior to the exterior. Today’s automotive plastics make up approximately 50% of the volume of a new light vehicle but less than 10% of its weight.
We have developed molds and having regular production of Automotive Plastic Parts which supply for automotive industry. We have coperated with several well known auto manufacturers.

Recycled plastics refer to plastic materials that are repurposed. It can come from other plastic products or waste that results from the plastic injection moulding process. These recycled materials can be of any type or colour, and when you use them to manufacture products via injection moulding, there is no loss in quality.

At DJmolding, our on-demand, low-volume production offering with injection molding—which uses aluminum tooling—is a fast, cost-effective way to produce hundreds of thousands of end-use molded parts.

With over thousands of plastic injection molding and plastic manufacturing facilities to choose from all over the word, what are one of the top qualities that make a molding company stand out? When choosing a provider, many factors should be taken into consideration; including capabilities, quality assurance, company reputation, cost, and delivery time. Finding the right plastic injection molder to fit your needs may seem time-consuming but determining your low and high-volume requirements first and how they may shift over time, will help to narrow down your options.
